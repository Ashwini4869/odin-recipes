    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a great recipe for smoked turkey. A barbecue grill is nearly
      impossible to cook a large bird. A smoker is best for this. I prefer
      hickory chips or hickory wood. Hickory generates a more even smokiness
      than other woods, and it does not matter whether the wood is green or
      seasoned. Mesquite, if not well seasoned, will generate a creosote type
      coating because of the sap that oozes out of the wood while cooking.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1(10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed.</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
      <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans cola-flavored carbonated beverage</li>
      <li>1 apple, quartered</li>
      <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Rinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry. Rub the crushed garlic over
        the outside of the bird, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Place in a
        disposable roasting pan. Fill turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple,
        onion, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper. Cover loosely with
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smoke at 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C) for 10 hours, or
        until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) when
        measured in the thickest part of the thigh. Baste the bird every 1 to 2
        hours with the juices from the bottom of the roasting pan.
