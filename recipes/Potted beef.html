    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Old fashioned potted beef is great on toast. This recipe was invented to
      be kept for long periods of time unrefrigerated, but in practice it must
      be kept in the refrigerator and used within a week. Other kinds of meat
      may be used instead of beef.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound beef stew meat, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>Â¼ pound butter</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>paprika to taste</li>
      <li>ground nutmeg to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a heavy medium saucepan, simmer the beef in 1/4 inch of water. Stew
        until very tender, about 2 to 3 hours, replacing water as necessary.
        Drain, reserving the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pass the cooked stew meat through a meat grinder twice, until it is the
        consistency of a thick, stringy paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Filter the melted butter through
        clean muslin (cheese cloth), to remove the milk solids.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix the cooked meat with 3/4 of the strained, melted
        butter. Season with salt, pepper, paprika and nutmeg to taste. Stir in
        desired amount of reserved cooking liquid to moisten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the mixture to sterile containers and top with remaining
        butter. Seal and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
